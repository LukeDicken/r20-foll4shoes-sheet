This is a [Roll20](roll20/net) Custom Sheet for the [Roll for Shoes](https://rollforshoes.com/) TTRPG rules-light system.

It is fairly minimal and tracks the following:

- Character name (which also updates the character sheet name in r20)
- Current XP, as well as buttons to spend and add XP
- Skills
- Weaknesses
- Statuses
- Damage

When a skill is rolled, the character sheet will automatically highlight if a new skill has been earned, or how many XP should be spent in order to earn one.

When a Weakness is rolled, it will automatically roll the relevant dice and keep only the worst result

Status/Damage is just a tracker and does not have mechanical implications in order to maintain flexibility
